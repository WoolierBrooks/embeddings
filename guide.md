About the journal
Aims and scope
The premier methodology journal in the field
The Journal of Biomedical Informatics (JBI) is the premier methodology journal in the field of biomedical informatics.
JBI publishes research on new methodologies and techniques that have general applicability and form the basis for
the evolving science of biomedical informatics. Papers should focus on a real-world biomedical or clinical problem,
develop a novel approach to address the problem, and evaluate its appropriateness in comparison to the current
state-of-the-art (SoA) methods. Involvement of healthcare professionals in motivating the work and evaluation of
results is expected.
Focus Areas and Topics of Interest
JBI seeks to publish papers that make a conceptual contribution to the field, typically by describing an innovation in
methodology or technique or by discussing substantive generalizable lessons that have been learned in the context of
an informatics project. When a methodological contribution has a theoretical basis, that theory is an appropriate
emphasis for papers as well. Research papers may also present a novel "method of methods" explaining how to
apply the existing methods to a space of biomedical problems that share unique characteristics influencing the
choice of methods.
JBI publishes papers on a wide range of informatics topics. However, across these topics, papers must build on deep
understanding and utilization of medical domain knowledge and should consider pragmatic translation for clinical
care or applications. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) clinical decision support, patient safety, natural
language processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, knowledge representation for healthcare,
translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and clinical informatics. Additional considerations for
papers in the areas of translational bioinformatics, machine learning, security and privacy are provided below.
Irrespective of the topic, papers must focus on novel informatics methods and its comparison to the current
approaches.
Manuscripts can be submitted in the following categories: original research, methodological review, commentaries,
special communication, letters to the editor, book reviews, and editorials (see additional details on each of these
categories below). Given the international readership of JBI, country-specific health systems or approaches will be
considered only if they offer generalizable lessons that are relevant to the broader readership, regardless of their
country, language, culture, or health system.
Specific considerations for manuscripts in certain topical areas have also been provided in recent editorials.
If you are considering an article with a focus on translational bioinformatics , please read this editorial. Biologic
discoveries based on the use of routine informatics techniques may be important biologic contributions, but are not
suitable forJBI. In addition, please note that JBI publishes bioinformatics papers only if they deal with issues in
translational (human) science (e.g., translational bioinformatics papers).
If you are considering an article describing a new machine learning approach, please read this editorial. Machine
learning papers would be considered only if the methods that are introduced demonstrate substantial novelty and
advancement beyond the current SoA and their evaluation is sound and includes an assessment of the potential of
the method to be used in clinical practice. For example, submissions reporting publishing marginally SoA findings
without an in-depth analysis or discussion of how the methods are potentially generalizable (or applicable in a wider
setting) would not be considered. Novel and important clinical problems addressed by existing machine learning
methods may warrant Special Communication papers if their discussion includes novel insights or lessons learned
for future research in such domains.
Authors considering an article on biomedical privacy and security, please read this editorial. To be considered, the
privacy and security methods that are introduced should demonstrate substantial novelty and advancement beyond
the SoA, should be specific to the biomedical informatics domain, and their practical application and/or likely realworld usefulness in the biomedical domain.
Please also note that papers related to signal processing, imaging, medical devices, or communication networks are
generally considered outside the scope of the journal. To be considered, such papers must introduce novel
informatics methods that build on deep understanding and utilization of medical domain knowledge and should be
translatable into applications. Papers on such topics should focus on information processing and management or
knowledge-based approaches.
Please also consult the editorial that explains where to direct Artificial Intelligence in Medicine-related manuscripts
for peer review and possible publication, considering the different scope of the three Elsevier medical informatics
journals: JBI, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, and Intelligence-based Medicine.
Article types
Original research: Presentation and discussion of a biomedically or clinically motivated system or approach that has
required the development of innovative methods rather than the application of established techniques. Motivating
applications may be discussed, but the new method should be discussed so that generalizability is clear, ideally with
an assessment of its range of applicability. Please choose the article type "Research Paper" during the submission
process.
Methodological review: Reviews of a methodological approach that summarize its introduction, use, successes, and
limitations. Such reviews will also often propose future research directions or critique a method and discuss the
range of problems for which it may not be an appropriate solution. Note that such reviews should focus on a method
or approach, not on specific application domain (e.g., avoid submitting on reviews such as "Computers in Diabetes
Management"). Please choose the article type "Review article" during the submission process.
To ensure that your methodological review to JBI is considered, please bear in mind that:
1. The paper should meet JBI's Aims and Scope - focus on novel biomedical informatics methods that have been
developed rather than on application of methods.
2. In a methodological review you are expected to specify the systematic methods (including the exact search terms
and the resources that were searched (e.g., Pubmed, Scholar) by which you searched for papers, and present a
Prisma Diagram https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-flow-diagram
3. The focus of the review should not be too broad nor too narrow. 4) The paper should follow an informed and
relevant way to organize the breadth of papers; a simple bibliometric organization, like the countries and years
of publication, the diseases in which the methods have been applied is not appropriate.
4. The Discussion should bring new insights to developers of novel biomedical informatics methods.
5. The methods reviewed should be translational to medicine.
6. Please also explain in the Statement of Significance how you go beyond existing surveys related to your topic -
see Statement of Significance.
Special communication: These are articles that address an issue of broad interest to the methodologically-oriented
informatics research community and clearly communicate generalizable novel
conclusions/recommendations/lessons-learned that are useful to the developers or users of biomedical informatics
methods. These lessons should be based on the application of existing biomedical informatics methods and should
present such results. They may report on the results of research studies, including an application of an existing
biomedical informatics approach in a new informatics domain. Alternatively, they could report on widely adopted
biomedical informatics tools or standards (e.g., REDCap, FHIR, OMOP, openEHR).
If submission of a special communication is being considered, please submit a brief proposal to
morpeleg@is.haifa.ac.il beforehand. If your submission of a Special Communication has been approved by the
editor, please choose the article type "Short Communication" during the submission process and specify in the cover
letter that your manuscript is intended as a Special Communication. Note that this is just a category of submission,
used for technical reasons in the Editorial Manager information system; your paper does not need to be particularly
short.
Commentaries: These are articles, generally shorter than research papers, that tend to discuss previously published
articles or a theme that is an important area of focus for the methodological basis of biomedical informatics
research and its application. Commentaries are often invited, but may be submitted by anyone after a discussion
with the editors. If submission of a commentary is being considered, please submit a brief proposal to
morpeleg@is.haifa.ac.il beforehand. If your submission of a Commentary has been solicited, or approved by the
editor, please choose the article type " Commentary" during the submission process and specify in the cover letter
that your manuscript is intended as a Commentary.
Letters to the Editor: Letters may be submitted and will be considered for possible publication in the journal. They
typically comment on a previously published paper. Please choose the article type "Correspondence" during the
submission process.
Book reviews: The editors will occasionally identify a new book that is likely to be of interest to the JBI readership.
They will invite individuals to write reviews of these volumes, and such submissions are by invitation only. Unsolicited
book reviews will not be considered. Please choose the article type "Book review" during the submission process.
Editorials: The editors or their invitees will occasionally publish editorials, but unsolicited editorials will not be
considered. Please choose the article type "Editorial" during the submission process.
When an author is submitting a manuscript in response to a call for papers for a Special Issue, the submission
category should be the Special Issue title, but the cover letter should indicate whether the article is an original
research paper, methodological review, a special communication, or a commentary.
All submissions should:
Include a structured abstract (Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion; with a total of <=300 words)
Keywords
The body of the manuscript should be structured according to (Introduction, Related Work, Methods, Results,
Discussion, and Conclusion; with a total of <=6000 words)
The total number of figures and tables <=8
Special Issues
We aim for special issues that are likely to attract enough high quality papers to justify creating a dedicated issue on
the topic. We look for topics that are closely aligned with the editorial policy of goals of JBI. A statement of our
editorial policy ("Aims and Scope"), and our emphasis on methodological innovation and methodological reviews,
rather than on applications or evaluations, is provided on the JBI Aims and Scope page:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-biomedical-informatics/about/aims-and-scope
Note that JBI does not publish papers that are primarily related to biomedical engineering (including image or signal
analysis), and any bioinformatics papers must be explicitly related to human health and/or disease (translational
bioinformatics). We stress that the theme of special issues should generally be an important methodological focus
rather than an application domain. Thus we would, for example, entertain special issues on "Informatics Methods for
Medical Privacy" or"Evolutionary Computation in Biomedicine" (both published in 2014) but not "Informatics in
Diabetes Care."
JBI does not entertain special issues that are drawn from papers originally presented at a conference or workshop.
Sometimes meetings inspire the notion for a special issue, but we do not publish papers that appeared in the
proceedings of conferences (see http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2005.10.002). The Call for Papers must make it clear
that we seek open submissions to the special issue, not limited to people who may have attended or presented work
at a specific meeting. If submitted papers are based on reports that were previously published in a conference
proceedings, they must be substantially expanded, typically updating or providing more detail on what was
previously presented at the conference. All papers must be reviewed in accordance with the usual JBI review process,
with its emphasis on innovative methodology (rather than novel applications of well-known methods), and even
invited papers cannot be assured of acceptance until they have met our standards for peer review.
The guest editor manages the special issue using JBI's editorial system (Editorial Manager), serving as a temporary
associate editor, although the Editor-in-Chief retains the final decision on the acceptance of papers and works
closely with the guest editor(s) during the editorial process. When submitted papers are authored or coauthored by
one of the guest editors, that paper is handled by a different associate editor, even though the paper is intended for
the special issue.
When a paper is accepted to a JBI Special Issue it is immediately placed into the next volume of JBI. When the Guest
Editor finalizes the Special Issue the previously accepted and published papers are assembled into the Special Issue
along with an invited editorial from the Guest Editor putting Special Issue and the papers it contains into a broader
context.
Any team of guest editors who wishes to submit a Special Issue proposal need to include one of JBI's Associate
Editors (or former Associate Editor of JBI). This person would be the Managing Guest Editor and should be the one
who submits the proposal via email to the Deputy Editor.
The proposal for a special issue also involves the preparation of a draft Call for Papers. Examples of such 1-2 page
Calls for Papers have appeared in JBI on ScienceDirect over the last several years. Potential guest editors are
encouraged to refer to them for templates to follow: (https://shorturl.at/irEQ9)
A proposed time line for the submission of manuscripts and the reviewing/revising process is also requested, and
should be planned for around 12 months, although the time to completion of a special issue is very hard to predict
given the vagaries of reviewing times, delays while papers are being revised, and the need for several rounds of
reviews for some papers before they are suitable for publication.
Associate Editors who have reviewed the criteria above and wish to prepare a proposal for a special issue should
contact the Deputy Editor (jbi.special.issues@gmail.com) and submit a 1-2 page proposal using the template at this
link. All sections A-C and 1-11 are required.
Note also that JBI has transitioned to become an online-only journal, given the straightforward access to all content
online. The journal has also moved to an article-based publishing model which has a positive effect on the
satisfaction of authors who submit papers to special issues. An editorial that describes those changes in detail can
be found here.
Peer review
This journal follows a single anonymized review process. Your submission will initially be assessed by our editors to
determine suitability for publication in this journal. If your submission is deemed suitable, it will typically be sent to a
minimum of two reviewers for an independent expert assessment of the scientific quality. The decision as to whether
your article is accepted or rejected will be taken by our editors.
Read more about peer review.
Our editors are not involved in making decisions about papers which:
they have written themselves.
have been written by family members or colleagues.
relate to products or services in which they have an interest.
Any such submissions will be subject to the journal's usual procedures and peer review will be handled independently
of the editor involved and their research group. Read more about editor duties.
Authors may submit a formal appeal request to the editorial decision, provided it meets all the requirements and
follows the procedure outlined in Elsevier’s Appeal Policy. Only one appeal per submission will be considered and the
appeal decision will be final.
Special issues and article collections
The peer review process for special issues and article collections follows the same process as outlined above for
regular submissions, except, a guest editor may send the submissions out to the reviewers and may recommend a
decision to the journal editor. The journal editor oversees the peer review process of all special issues and article
collections to ensure the high standards of publishing ethics and responsiveness are respected and is responsible for
the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles.
Open access
We refer you to our open access information page to learn about open access options for this journal.

Submission declaration
When authors submit an article to an Elsevier journal it is implied that:
the work described has not been published previously except in the form of a preprint, an abstract, a published
lecture, academic thesis or registered report. See our policy on multiple, redundant or concurrent publication.
the article is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
the article's publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where
the work was carried out.
if accepted, the article will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language,
including electronically, without the written consent of the copyright-holder.
To verify compliance with our journal publishing policies, we may check your manuscript with our screening tools.
Authorship
All authors should have made substantial contributions to all of the following:
1. The conception and design of the study, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data.
2. Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content.
3. Final approval of the version to be submitted.
Authors should appoint a corresponding author to communicate with the journal during the editorial process. All
authors should agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work to ensure that the questions related to the
accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
Changes to authorship
The editors of this journal generally will not consider changes to authorship once a manuscript has been submitted.
It is important that authors carefully consider the authorship list and order of authors and provide a definitive
author list at original submission.
The policy of this journal around authorship changes:
All authors must be listed in the manuscript and their details entered into the submission system.
Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should only be made prior to
acceptance, and only if approved by the journal editor.
Requests to change authorship should be made by the corresponding author, who must provide the reason for
the request to the journal editor with written confirmation from all authors, including any authors being added
or removed, that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement.
All requests to change authorship must be submitted using this form. Requests which do not comply with the
instructions outlined in the form will not be considered.
Only in exceptional circumstances will the journal editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of
authors post acceptance.
Publication of the manuscript may be paused while a change in authorship request is being considered.
Any authorship change requests approved by the journal editor will result in a corrigendum if the manuscript has
already been published.
Any unauthorized authorship changes may result in the rejection of the article, or retraction, if the article has
already been published.
Declaration of competing interests
All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could
inappropriately influence or bias their work. Examples of potential competing interests include:
Employment
Consultancies
Stock ownership
Honoraria
Paid expert testimony
Patent applications or registrations
Grants or any other funding
Affiliation with the journal as an Editor or Advisory Board Member
The declarations tool should always be completed.
Authors with a journal affiliation to declare should enter the following text under “Other Activities” within
the declarations tool and should inform the journal and publisher prior to completing the submission process:
Given their role as [insert journal role title], [insert your name] had no involvement in the peer-review of this article and
has no access to information regarding its peer-review. Full responsibility for the editorial process for this article was
delegated to another journal editor.
Editorial disclosure statements will be included as a footnote and/or in the declaration of competing interest section
of the article.
Authors with no competing interests to declare should select the option "I have nothing to declare".
The resulting Word document containing your declaration should be uploaded at the "attach/upload files" step in the
submission process. It is important that the Word document is saved in the .doc/.docx file format. Author signatures
are not required.
Funding sources
Authors must disclose any funding sources who provided financial support for the conduct of the research and/or
preparation of the article. The role of sponsors, if any, should be declared in relation to the study design, collection,
analysis and interpretation of data, writing of the report and decision to submit the article for publication. If funding
sources had no such involvement this should be stated in your submission.
List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:
Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa].
It is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants, scholarships and awards. When
funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution,
submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.
If no funding has been provided for the research, it is recommended to include the following sentence:
This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
Declaration of generative AI use
Authors must declare the use of generative AI in the manuscript preparation process upon submission of the paper.
Elsevier recognizes the potential of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies (“AI Tools”), when used responsibly, to
help researchers work efficiently, gain critical insights fast and achieve better outcomes. Increasingly, these tools,
including AI agents and deep research tools, are helping researchers to synthesize complex literature, provide an
overview of a field or research question, identify research gaps, generate ideas, and provide tailored support for
tasks such as content organization and improving language and readability.
Authors preparing a manuscript for an Elsevier journal can use AI Tools to support them. However, these tools must
never be used as a substitute for human critical thinking, expertise and evaluation. AI technology should always be
applied with human oversight and control.
Ultimately, authors are responsible and accountable for the contents of their work. This includes accountability for:
Carefully reviewing and verifying the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and impartiality of all AI-generated output
(including checking the sources, as AI-generated references can be incorrect or fabricated).
Editing and adapting all material thoroughly to ensure the manuscript represents the author’s authentic and
original contribution and reflects their own analysis, interpretation, insights and ideas.
Ensuring the use of any tools or sources, AI-based or otherwise, is made clear and transparent to readers. If AI
Tools have been used, we require a disclosure statement upon submission; please see example below.
Ensuring the manuscript is developed in a way that safeguards data privacy, intellectual property and other
rights, by checking the terms and conditions of any AI tool that is used.
Finally, authors must not list or cite AI Tools as an author or co-author on the manuscript since authorship implies
responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to, and performed by, humans.
The use of AI Tools in the manuscript preparation process must be declared by adding a statement at the end of the
manuscript when the paper is first submitted. The statement will appear in the published work and should be placed
in a new section before the references list.
An example:
Title of new section: Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the manuscript preparation
process.
Statement: During the preparation of this work the author(s) used [NAME OF TOOL / SERVICE] in order to [REASON].
After using this tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility
for the content of the published article.
The declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools, such as tools used to check grammar, spelling and
references. If you have nothing to disclose, you do not need to add a statement.
Please read Elsevier’s author policy on the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies, which can be found in
our generative AI policies for journals.
Please note: to protect authors’ rights and the confidentiality of their research, this journal does not currently allow
the use of generative AI or AI-assisted technologies such as ChatGPT or similar services by reviewers or editors in the
peer review and manuscript evaluation process, as is stated in our generative AI policies for journals. We are actively
evaluating compliant AI Tools and may revise this policy in the future.
Preprints
Preprint sharing
Authors may share preprints in line with Elsevier's article sharing policy. Sharing preprints, such as on a preprint
server, will not count as prior publication.
We advise you to read our policy on multiple, redundant or concurrent publication.
Preprint posting on SSRN
In support of Open Science, this journal offers its authors a free preprint posting service on SSRN, Elsevier’s preprint
and early research repository.
During submission to this journal, you can choose to post your manuscript on SSRN, and it will be made publicly
available as soon as it passes the journal's initial desk review.
As a preprint on SSRN, your manuscript will benefit from:
Early registration with a preprint DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
A link from the preprint to the version of record if published in this Elsevier journal
Preprint posting, sharing, and download availability that facilitates collaboration and early citations
Your decision to post or not post your preprint will have no effect on the editorial process or publication outcome
with the journal. For additional information, please consult the SSRN Terms of Use and FAQs.
It is expected that the corresponding author will seek approval from all co-authors before agreeing to post the
manuscript publicly, prior to peer review, on SSRN.
Use of inclusive language
Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes
equal opportunities. Authors should ensure their work uses inclusive language throughout and contains nothing
which might imply one individual is superior to another on the grounds of:
age
gender
race
ethnicity
culture
sexual orientation
disability or health condition
We recommend avoiding the use of descriptors about personal attributes unless they are relevant and valid. Write
for gender neutrality with the use of plural nouns ("clinicians, patients/clients") as default. Wherever possible, avoid
using "he, she," or"he/she."
No assumptions should be made about the beliefs of readers and writing should be free from bias, stereotypes,
slang, reference to dominant culture and/or cultural assumptions.
These guidelines are meant as a point of reference to help you identify appropriate language but are by no means
exhaustive or definitive.
Reporting sex- and gender-based analyses
There is no single, universally agreed-upon set of guidelines for defining sex and gender. We offer the following
guidance:
Sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA) should be integrated into research design when research involves or
pertains to humans, animals or eukaryotic cells. This should be done in accordance with any requirements set by
funders or sponsors and best practices within a field.
Sex and/or gender dimensions of the research should be addressed within the article or declared as a limitation
to the generalizability of the research.
Definitions of sex and/or gender applied should be explicitly stated to enhance the precision, rigor and
reproducibility of the research and to avoid ambiguity or conflation of terms and the constructs to which they
refer.
We advise you to read the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines and the SAGER checklist (PDF) on the
EASE website, which offer systematic approaches to the use of sex and gender information in study design, data
analysis, outcome reporting and research interpretation.
For further information we suggest reading the rationale behind and recommended use of the SAGER guidelines.
Definitions of sex and/or gender
We ask authors to define how sex and gender have been used in their research and publication. Some guidance:
Sex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features
such as chromosomal genotype, hormonal levels, internal and external anatomy. A binary sex categorization
(male/female) is usually designated at birth ("sex assigned at birth") and is in most cases based solely on the
visible external anatomy of a newborn. In reality, sex categorizations include people who are intersex/have
differences of sex development (DSD).
Gender generally refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors and identities of women, men and gender-diverse
people that occur in a historical and cultural context and may vary across societies and over time. Gender
influences how people view themselves and each other, how they behave and interact and how power is
distributed in society.
Depending on the focus of a paper, sex and/or gender may or may not be relevant to the content of the paper. We
recognize that beliefs, attitudes, and laws relating to sex and gender may vary. These articles do not attempt to
dictate author beliefs but rather require that, where relevant to an author’s research or paper, the author must
provide clear explanations of how the paper and research define and use sex and gender.
Jurisdictional claims
Elsevier respects the decisions taken by its authors as to how they choose to designate territories and identify their
affiliations in their published content. Elsevier’s policy is to take a neutral position with respect to territorial disputes
or jurisdictional claims, including, but not limited to, maps and institutional affiliations. For journals that Elsevier
publishes on behalf of a third party owner, the owner may set its own policy on these issues.
Maps: Readers should be able to locate any study areas shown within maps using common mapping platforms.
Maps should only show the area actually studied and authors should not include a location map which displays a
larger area than the bounding box of the study area. Authors should add a note clearly stating that "map lines
delineate study areas and do not necessarily depict accepted national boundaries”. During the review process,
Elsevier’s editors may request authors to change maps if these guidelines are not followed.
Institutional affiliations: Authors should use either the full, standard title of their institution or the standard
abbreviation of the institutional name so that the institutional name can be independently verified for research
integrity purposes.
Studies in humans
Authors must follow ethical guidelines for studies carried out in humans.
Work which involves the use of human subjects should be carried out in accordance with the World Medical
Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.
Manuscripts should follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations for the
conduct, reporting, editing and publication of scholarly work in medical journals and aim to be representative of
human populations in terms of sex, age and ethnicity. Sex and gender terms should be used correctly, as outlined by
WHO (World Health Organization).
Manuscripts must include a statement that all procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and
institutional guidelines and have been approved by the appropriate institutional committee(s). The statement should
contain the date and reference number of the ethical approval(s) obtained.
Manuscripts must also include a statement that the privacy rights of human subjects have been observed and that
informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects.
This journal will not accept manuscripts that contain data derived from unethically sourced organs or tissue,
including from executed prisoners or prisoners of conscience, consistent with recommendations by Global Rights
Compliance on Mitigating Human Rights Risks in Transplantation Medicine. For all studies that use human organs or
tissues, sufficient evidence must be provided that these were procured in line with WHO Guiding Principles on
Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation. For clinical studies, a statement of informed consent having been
obtained from a patient or their nominated representative, paired with ethical approval for the study from a suitable
institution, as required by the policies of the journal, may be considered sufficient evidence, but the journal reserves
the right to request additional evidence in cases where it feels this is not sufficient. The source of the organs or
tissues used in clinical research must be transparent and traceable. If your manuscript describes organ
transplantation you must additionally declare within the manuscript that:
autonomous consent free from coercion was obtained from the donor(s) or their next of kin.
organs and/or tissues were not sourced from executed prisoners or prisoners of conscience.
Studies in animals
Authors must follow ethical guidelines for studies carried out in animals.
All animal experiments should comply with ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.
Studies should be carried out in accordance with Guidance on the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986 and associated guidelines, EU Directive 2010/63 for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes or
the NIH (National Research Council) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PDF).
The sex of animals, and where appropriate, the influence (or association) of sex on the results of the study must be
indicated and a statement included in your manuscript that such guidelines as listed above have been followed.
Informed consent and patient details
Authors must document in the manuscript that ethics committee approval and informed consent have been
obtained for studies involving patients or volunteers (including organ/tissue donors). Key guidelines:
Appropriate consents, permissions and releases must be obtained if case details, personal information and
images of patients or any other individuals are included in a publication, even if anonymized.
Patient and research subjects’ names, initials, hospital or social security numbers, dates of birth or any other
personal or identifying information should never be used, even where consent has been provided.
Written consents must be retained. They should not be provided to this journal unless this is specifically requested in
exceptional circumstances, for example, when a legal issue arises. Only then should you provide copies of the
consents, or evidence that all relevant consents were obtained.
Personal details of any patient must only be included in your article or in any supplementary materials (including all
images and videos) in cases where written permission has been given by the patient (or, where applicable, the next of
kin).
We advise you to review Elsevier’s policy on patient consent prior to preparing your manuscript.
Delayed publication
If you need to delay the publication of your article for any reason, please contact the editorial office of the journal or
ourJournal Article Publishing Support Center at the earliest possible opportunity. While we will try to ensure that
your article is not published before a certain date if you make your request on a timely basis, we cannot guarantee
this. Please also note that once the agreed period of delay has expired the article may be published at any time
thereafter.
Writing and formatting
File format
We ask you to provide editable source files for your entire submission (including figures, tables and text graphics).
Some guidelines:
Save files in an editable format, using the extension .doc/.docx for Word files and .tex for LaTeX files. A PDF is not
an acceptable source file.
Format Word files in a single-column layout. Double-column formatting is only permitted for LaTeX submissions.
Remove any strikethrough and underlined text from your manuscript, unless it has scientific significance related
to your article.
Use spell-check and grammar-check functions to avoid errors.
We advise you to read our Step-by-step guide to publishing with Elsevier.
LaTeX
We encourage you use our LaTeX template when preparing a LaTeX submission. You will be asked to provide all

Title page
You are required to include the following details in the title page information:
Article title. Article titles should be concise and informative. Please avoid abbreviations and formulae, where
possible, unless they are established and widely understood, e.g. DNA.
Author names. Provide the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author. The order of authors should match
the order in the submission system. Carefully check that all names are accurately spelled. If needed, you can add
your name between parentheses in your own script after the English transliteration.
Affiliations. Add affiliation addresses, referring to where the work was carried out, below the author names.
Indicate affiliations using a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the
corresponding address. Ensure that you provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country
name and, if available, the email address of each author.
Corresponding author. Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence for your article at all stages of the
refereeing and publication process and also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future
queries about your results, data, methodology and materials. It is important that the email address and contact
details of your corresponding author are kept up to date during the submission and publication process.
Present/permanent address. If an author has moved since the work described in your article was carried out, or
the author was visiting during that time, a "present address" (or"permanent address") can be indicated by a
footnote to the author's name. The address where the author carried out the work must be retained as their main
affiliation address. Use superscript Arabic numerals for such footnotes.
Abstract
You are required to provide a concise and factual abstract which does not exceed 250 words. The abstract should
briefly state the purpose of your research, principal results and major conclusions. Some guidelines:
Abstracts must be able to stand alone as abstracts are often presented separately from the article.
Avoid references. If any are essential to include, ensure that you cite the author(s) and year(s).
Avoid non-standard or uncommon abbreviations. If any are essential to include, ensure they are defined within
your abstract at first mention.
Keywords
You are required to provide 1 to 7 keywords for indexing purposes. Keywords should be written in English. Please try
to avoid keywords consisting of multiple words (using "and" or"of").
We recommend that you only use abbreviations in keywords if they are firmly established in the field.
Graphical abstract
You are required to provide a graphical abstract at submission.
The graphical abstract summarizes the contents of your article in a concise, pictorial, professional form, highlighting
important aspects of the research. It is designed to appeal to an interdisciplinary audience, and draw more attention
to your online article. Some guidelines:
Ensure you have obtained the necessary permission to include any third party owned material in a graphical
abstract.
Use of generative AI or AI-assisted tools in the production of graphical abstracts must align with Elsevier’s GenAI
Policies forJournals.
Submit your graphical abstract as a separate file in the online submission system.
Ensure the image is 531 x 1328 pixels (h x w) or proportionally more, and is readable at a size of 5 x 13 cm.
Preferred file types for graphical abstracts are TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files.
More information, examples and a template can be found in the graphical abstract guidelines.
Math formulae
Submit math equations as editable text, not as images.
Present simple formulae in line with normal text, where possible.
Use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms such as X/Y.
Present variables in italics.
Denote powers of e by exp.
Display equations separately from your text, numbering them consecutively in the order they are referred to
within your text.
Tables
Tables must be submitted as editable text, not as images. Some guidelines:
Place tables next to the relevant text or on a separate page(s) at the end of your article.
Cite all tables in the manuscript text.
Number tables consecutively according to their appearance in the text.
Please provide captions along with the tables.
Place any table notes below the table body.
Avoid vertical rules and shading within table cells.
We recommend that you use tables sparingly, ensuring that any data presented in tables is not duplicating results
described elsewhere in the article.
Figures, images and artwork
Figures, images, artwork, diagrams and other graphical media must be supplied as separate files along with the
manuscript. We recommend that you read our detailed artwork and media instructions. Some excerpts:
When submitting artwork:
Cite all images in the manuscript text.
Number images according to the sequence they appear within your article.
Submit each image as a separate file using a logical naming convention for your files (for example, Figure_1,
Figure_2 etc).
Text graphics may be embedded in the text at the appropriate position. If you are working with LaTeX, text
graphics may also be embedded in the file.
Figure captions
All images must have a caption. A caption should consist of a brief title (not displayed on the figure itself) and a
description of the image. We advise you to keep the amount of text in any image to a minimum, though any symbols
and abbreviations used should be explained.
Read how to add captions to your submission here.
Artwork formats
When your artwork is finalized, "save as" or convert your electronic artwork to the formats listed below taking into
account the given resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations:
Vector drawings: Save as EPS or PDF files embedding the font or saving the text as "graphics."
Color or grayscale photographs (halftones): Save as TIFF, JPG or PNG files using a minimum of 300 dpi (for single
column width: min. 1063 pixels, full page width: 2244 pixels).
Bitmapped line drawings: Save as TIFF, JPG or PNG files, using a minimum of 1000 dpi (for single column width:
min. 3543 pixels, full page width: 7480 pixels).
Combinations bitmapped line/halftones (color or grayscale): Save as TIFF, JPG or PNG files using a minimum of
500 dpi (for single column: min. 1772 pixels, full page width: 3740 pixels).
Please do not submit:
Files that are too low in resolution.
Disproportionally large images compared to font size, as text may become unreadable.
Color artwork
If you submit usable color figures with your accepted article, we will ensure that they appear in color online.
Please ensure that color images are accessible to all, including those with impaired color vision. Learn more about
color and web accessibility.
Generative AI and Figures, images and artwork
Please read our policy on the use of generative AI and AI-assisted tools in figures, images and artwork, which can be
found in Elsevier’s GenAI Policies forJournals. This policy states:
We do not permit the use of Generative AI or AI-assisted tools to create or alter images in submitted
manuscripts.
The only exception is if the use of AI or AI-assisted tools is part of the research design or methods (for example, in
the field of biomedical imaging). If this is the case, such use must be described in a reproducible manner in the
methods section, including the name of the model or tool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer.
The use of generative AI or AI-assisted tools in the production of artwork such as for graphical abstracts is not
permitted. The use of generative AI in the production of cover art may in some cases be allowed, if the author
obtains prior permission from the journal editor and publisher, can demonstrate that all necessary rights have
been cleared for the use of the relevant material, and ensures that there is correct content attribution.
Supplementary material
We encourage the use of supplementary materials such as applications, images and sound clips to enhance
research. Some guidelines:
Supplementary material should be accurate and relevant to the research.
Cite all supplementary files in the manuscript text.
Submit all supplementary materials at the same time as your manuscript.
Include a concise, descriptive caption for each supplementary file, describing its content.
After submission supplementary files can only be added or replaced in the revision stage of the editorial process.
Be aware that all supplementary materials provided will appear online in the exact same way as received. These
files will not be checked, formatted or typeset by the production team.
Video
This journal accepts video material and animation sequences to support and enhance your scientific research. We
encourage you to include links to video or animation files within articles. Some guidelines:
When including video or animation file links within your article, refer to the video or animation content by adding
a note in your text where the file should be placed.
Clearly label files ensuring the given file name is directly related to the file content.
Provide files in one of our recommended file formats. Files should be within our preferred maximum file size of
150 MB per file, 1 GB in total.
Provide "stills" for each of your files. These will be used as standard icons to personalize the link to your video
data. You can choose any frame from your video or animation or make a separate image.
Provide descriptive text in your manuscript to refer to the video content. This text helps ensure accessibility for
visually impaired readers who rely on descriptive information. For journals publishing in print this is also
essential, as video and animation files cannot be embedded in the print version.
We publish all video and animation files supplied in the electronic version of your article.
For more detailed instructions, we recommend that you read our guidelines on submitting video content to be
included in the body of an article.

Statement of significance
At the end of the introduction, create a table using the following headings to summaries (in 150 words or less) the
contribution of your paper to the existing literature:
Problem or Issue
What is Already Known
What this Paper Adds
Who would benefit from the new knowledge in this paper
Example of Statement of Significance
Problem
Clinical trials' conclusions may not generalize to other patients.
What is Already Known
Although there have been many prior explorations comparing a trial sample with a potentially eligible cohort, a
prominent limitation in these methods is that their comparisons are between different clinical settings or
geographical locations.
What This Paper Adds
This study aims to build upon the prior generalizability assessment literature by controlling for clinical setting.
Additionally, this study has a unique opportunity to address a potential temporality concern for generalizability
assessments by focusing on when the trial was ongoing as opposed to when the trial was completed; this
opportunity is worthwhile because it further ensures the patients are subject to the same treatment opportunities.
Who would benefit from the knowledge in this paper
Clinicians who would like to know if the recommendations and conclusions of a clinical trial apply to their patient.

References
References within text
Any references cited within your article should also be present in your reference list and vice versa. Some guidelines:
References cited in your abstract must be given in full.
We recommend that you do not include unpublished results and personal communications in your reference list,
though you may mention them in the text of your article.
Any unpublished results and personal communications included in your reference list must follow the standard
reference style of the journal. In substitution of the publication date add "unpublished results" or"personal
communication."
References cited as "in press" imply that the item has been accepted for publication.
Linking to cited sources will increase the discoverability of your research.
Before submission, check that all data provided in your reference list are correct, including any references which
have been copied. Providing correct reference data allows us to link to abstracting and indexing services such as
Scopus, Crossref and PubMed. Any incorrect surnames, journal or book titles, publication years or pagination within
your references may prevent link creation.
We encourage the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) as reference links as they provide a permanent link to the
electronic article referenced.
Reference format
This journal does not set strict requirements on reference formatting at submission. Some guidelines:
References can be in any style or format as long as the style is consistent.
Author names, journal or book titles, chapter or article titles, year of publication, volume numbers, article
numbers or pagination must be included, where applicable.
Use of DOIs is recommended.
Our journal reference style will be applied to your article after acceptance, at proof stage. If required, at this stage
we will ask you to correct or supply any missing reference data.
Reference style
Indicate references by adding a number within square brackets in the text. You can refer to author names within your
text, but you must always give the reference number, e.g., "as demonstrated [3,6]. Barnaby and Jones [8] obtained a
different result ....".
Number references in the order they appear in your article.
Abbreviate journal names according to the List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA).
